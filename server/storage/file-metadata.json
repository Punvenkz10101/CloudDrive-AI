We systematically review 52 research papers from 2015 to\n2024, covering three core aspects: Al powered document processing and OCR technologies,\nsemantic searchable encryption mechanisms, and machine learning-based security\narchitectures for cloud storage. The analysis reveals that hybrid deep learning approaches\nachieve 99.2% OCR accuracy with 67% cost reduction compared to traditional methods. In\nsecurity domains, ensemble models demonstrate 99.3% attack detection rates with only 0.1%\nfalse positives. The survey identifies significant research gaps in cross-modal retrieval, quantum\nresistant encryption, and federated learning implementations. We present a novel taxonomy of\nintelligent storage systems and propose an architectural framework that integrates vector\ndatabases, serverless computing, and adaptive security models. The paper concludes with\nfuture research directions focusing on privacy-preserving Al, explainable machine learning, and\nedge cloud continuum architectures for next-generation intelligent storage solutions.\nCreated\n12/21/2025, 6:38:59 PM\nLast Modified\n12/21/2025, 6:38:59 PM\nAuthors\nPuneeth Venkat (REVA University) <puneethvenkat2k03@gmail.com>\nYashwanth S S (REVA University) <yashawanthss18@gmail.com>\nDhanushree Singh (REVA University) <dhanushreesingh12@gmail.com>\nDinesh R (REVA University) <dineshr2k24@gmail.com>\nSubmission Files\nCloudDriveAl_Survey_Paer.pdf (91 Kb, 12/21/2025, 6:38:54 PM)\nhttps://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICICGR2026/Submission/Summary/240                                                              4/1",
